# php-form-validation-upload
A sample for a PHP form validation using PHP and adding file upload functionality

## PHP Form validation

This samples was saw on a job add at UpWork.com, so if you got the skills to code it you may end up doing a few bucks for this.

## The requirements

The form should validate on the FrontEnd (with JS of course) and in the BackEnd (PHP) what the required and valid field inputs are. 

1- The first test would be to check if the *required* fields were filled.
2- Then check if the input is valid, example valid email address, password length and match, etc.

Do this on both sides (Front and BackEnd).

Additional asked requirement was to enable an upload images functionality and to limit the file upload to 3 images the most. This validation was performed on the BackEnd.
